# To-do list MERN app

This is suppose to be just a simple to-do list application

## Usage

### Create JSON file (optional)
If you want to test this API while it's not currently connected to a database yet , you can create a JSON file called ``` tasks.json``` where you will be able to handle the data.
The ``` tasks.json``` must be an array that contains objects with the following keys : ``` id``` , ``` task``` and ``` due```

Recomendations :

```
[
    {"id": 1 ,"task":"Wash dishes" , "due":"Sunday"},
    {"id": 2 ,"task":"Take trash out" , "due":"Thursday"},
    {"id": 3 ,"task":"Clean room" , "due":"Wednesday"},
    {"id": 4 ,"task":"Wash clothes" , "due":"Saturday"}
]
```
